/*
  Rugged Audio Shield sketch that demonstrates WAV file playback. The
  sketch simply plays a WAV file called SOMEFILE.WAV in the root
  directory of the microSD card, delays 1s, then repeats. The SOMEFILE.WAV
  file should have a duration less than 1 second (otherwise, increase
  the delay from 1s to something longer than the WAV file duration).

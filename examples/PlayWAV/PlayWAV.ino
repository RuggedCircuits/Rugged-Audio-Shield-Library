/*
  Rugged Audio Shield sketch that demonstrates WAV file playback. The
  sketch simply plays a WAV file called SOMEFILE.WAV in the root
  directory of the microSD card, delays 1s, then repeats.

  Moving beyond the PlayWAVBasic sketch, this sketch introduces more
  advanced usage such as checking for whether or not a microSD card
  is present, waiting for the WAV file to finish playing, and displaying
  an error code (if there was an error in playback).
